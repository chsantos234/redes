"Nomes alternativos:\nNils Sj\u00f6berg\nTaylor A. Swift\nTaylor Alison Swift\n\nDescri\u00e7\u00e3o:\nOne of the defining artists of the 2010s, Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter and actress who has achieved success in country, pop, and alternative. At the age of fourteen, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a career in country music, signing to Scott Borchetta\u2019s then-nonexistent label, Big Machine Records, in November 2004.\n\nSwift debuted in June 2006 with \u201cTim McGraw,\u201d an ode to a lover who would be leaving town. The song served as an introduction to her self-titled debut album, released on October 24, 2006, which featured the songs \u201cTeardrops on my Guitar,\u201d \u201cOur Song,\u201d \u201cPicture To Burn,\u201d and \u201cShould\u2019ve Said No\u201d as singles. This piece of work became the longest-charting album of the 2000s, spending 227 weeks on the Billboard 200.\n\nOn November 11, 2008, Swift released Fearless as her sophomore effort, which featured the songs \u201cFifteen,\u201d \u201cLove Story,\u201d \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d and \u201cYou Belong With Me as singles. Swift herself considers this album to be her breakthrough moment, and she obviously has a reason to think so: Fearless was her first number one and it became the most awarded country album of all time. Until Billie Eilish\u2019s 2020 win, then-20-year-old Swift was the youngest person to have ever won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nFollowing the success of Fearless, some had doubts about Swift\u2019s songwriting abilities, which led her to write her third album, Speak Now, alone to prove herself. The album was released on October 25, 2010, and featured \u201cMine,\u201d \u201cBack to December,\u201d \u201cMean,\u201d \u201cThe Story Of Us,\u201d and \u201cOurs\u201d as singles. As a result, Swift won many awards, including a Grammy for Best Country Album.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, Swift released her fourth studio album, Red, going through a quite dramatic visual change after straightening her signature curly hair. Songs such as \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble,\u201d \u201c22,\u201d \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d and \u201cEverything Has Changed were Billboard charting singles at the time they were released. The album made Taylor be a nominee for another Grammy award for Album Of The Year in 2013, and its fifth track, \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d was named as the best song of the 2010s by Rolling Stone.\n\nSwift\u2019s fifth album, 1989, came out on October 27, 2014, and was her official entrance to the Pop Music scene. It featured some of her biggest hits to date as singles, like \u201cBlank Space,\u201d \u201cStyle,\u201d \u201cOut Of The Woods,\u201d \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBad Blood,\u201d and \u201cWildest Dreams.\u201d 1989 was also the only album of 2014 to sell over a million copies in its first week and Swift won a Grammy award for Album Of The Year with it, making her the first woman to win Album of the Year twice for different genres.\n\nAround the time of her triumphant Grammy win, Swift became entangled in a highly-publicized feud with rapper Kanye West, who claimed that his interrupting her speech at the 2009 Video Music Awards was what \u201cmade [her] famous.\u201d After standing up for herself and claiming West never told her he would call her a \u201cbitch\u201d on the song, the public turned against Swift and began calling her things like a snake and a liar on social media.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Swift took a hiatus from the spotlight, breaking her typical cycle of releasing an album every two years. During this time, she has worked on songs like \u201cThis Is What You Came For,\u201d written alongside her then-boyfriend Calvin Harris under the pseudonym Nils Sj\u00f6berg, \u201cBetter Man,\u201d which she wrote for country group Little Big Town, and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever,\u201d a collaboration with ZAYN that was featured in the film Fifty Shades Darker.\n\nOn August 18, 2017, Swift wiped her social media accounts to tease the release of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d released at the end of that month, and her sixth studio album, reputation, which came out on November 10, 2017. \u201c\u2026Ready For It?,\u201d \u201cEnd Game,\u201d and \u201cDelicate\u201d were also featured as singles from that album. The record was responsible for her biggest sale at the time, selling over 1.2 million copies in the U.S.A. during its first week and also became the best-selling U.S. album of 2018.\n\nreputation was Swift\u2019s last album with Big Machine Records before signing with Republic Records. Following her new contract, Scott Borchetta sold Big Machine Records to entertainment mogul Scooter Braun. Swift took to social media to describe her disappointment, but vowed to re-record the albums Braun purchased so she could be the full owner. Scooter Braun would later sell Taylor\u2019s music to Shamrock Holdings in June of 2019.\n\nSwift\u2019s dedication to artistic ownership became a large focus of the Lover era \u2014 she co-produced most tracks on the album, as well as directing or co-directing each music video. The album was released on August 23, 2019, and featured \u201cLover,\u201d \u201cThe Man,\u201d \u201cYou Need To Calm Down,\u201d and \u201cME!\u201d as the innitial singles, before \u201cCruel Summer\u201d was also made a single in the summer of 2023. In November of 2019, the American Music Awards named Swift as the Artist of the Decade. That night, she also beat Michael Jackson\u2019s record to become the artist with the most AMA wins in history, earning her 29th award. The next month, Billboard also named Swift their Woman of the Decade.\n\nIn January 2020, Swift released Miss Americana, a documentary directed by Lana Wilson that offered fans an unprecedented glimpse into Swift\u2019s everyday life and decision to speak up about politics, alongside \u201cOnly The Young\u201d, a political track she wrote while recording Lover.\n\nOn July 24, 2020, Swift once again switched genres \u2013 this time taking on a more alternative route \u2013 when releasing her eighth studio album, folklore, after announcing it the day before, making it her first surprise release. The only single of the album was \u201ccardigan.\u201d While most of her work is autobiographical, she notably focused on telling other people\u2019s stories throughout this record. She went on to release Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions on Disney+, where she performed the whole album live for the first time. folklore won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in March 2021, making Swift the first woman and fourth artist overall to win Album of the Year three times.\n\nThe follow-up project, evermore, was released two days before Swift\u2019s 31st birthday, on December 11, 2020, expanding the stories she told on folklore, as well as becoming her second surprise release. The only single of the record was its first track, \u201cwillow.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Swift\u2019s focus was to finally start to regain ownership over her work. To make the releases more different and exciting, she added \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tracks to each re-recording, which are songs she originally wrote for each album, but, for some reason or another, didn\u2019t make the final cut.\n\nShe kicked off this era by releasing \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d in February, right before making Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version) her first re-recorded album, released on April 9, 2021. \u201cMr. Perfectly Fine\u201d was also a single from that record.\n\nSwift\u2019s second re-recording, this time of her fourth studio album, Red, came out on November 12, 2021. As singles, it featured \u201cI Bet You Think About Me,\u201d and the 10 Minute Version of \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d which became a short-film and starred the actors Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien.\n\nSwift\u2019s tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022, and tells the stories of many sleepless nights scattered throughout her life. The album features three singles: \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d \u201cBejeweled,\u201d and \u201cLavender Haze.\u201d Midnights helped Swift become the first artist in history to occupy the full top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, and broke the record for the most listened album in one day in Spotify.\n\nIn July 2023, Swift got back to re-releasing her old work. In the seventh day of that month, she released Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), which had the \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d track, \u201cI Can See You,\u201d as its only single. The music video for that song featured both Taylor Lautner, whom Swift had dated around the time of Speak Now\u2019s original release, and Joey King, who had starred in the music video for \u201cMean\u201d thirteen years prior.\n\nHer fourth re-recording, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), was released exactly 9 years after the original version of the album came out on October 27, 2014. The record contains five \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tracks and Swift herself considers this to be her favorite re-recording. Before the album came out, she had already released two re-recorded songs from it as singles: \u201cWildest Dreams (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d on September 17, 2022, and \u201cThis Love (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d on May 6, 2022."
